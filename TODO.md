# @profullstack/transcoder - Future Features

This document outlines potential features to enhance the @profullstack/transcoder module, making it more attractive and valuable to users.

## High-Impact, Easy-to-Implement Features

### 5. ‚úÖ Audio Enhancement (Implemented)

**What**: Normalize audio levels, reduce noise, and enhance clarity.

**Why**: "Perfect audio every time. No more straining to hear quiet videos or getting blasted by loud ones."

```javascript
// Example API
await transcode('input.mp4', 'output.mp4', {
  audio: {
    normalize: true,        // Normalize audio levels
    noiseReduction: 0.3,    // Reduce background noise (0.0 to 1.0)
    fadeIn: 1.5,            // Fade in duration in seconds
    fadeOut: 2.0,           // Fade out duration in seconds
    volume: 1.2             // Adjust volume (1.0 = original volume)
  }
});
```

### 7. üìà Progress Visualization (Not Implemented)

**What**: Web-based UI for monitoring transcoding progress.

**Why**: "See exactly what's happening with your videos in real-time. No more guessing when your videos will be ready."

```javascript
// Example API
const { outputPath, dashboardUrl } = await transcode('input.mp4', 'output.mp4', {
  dashboard: true
});
// Open dashboardUrl in a browser to see progress
```

## Medium-Term Features

### 11. üîç Video Analysis

**What**: Analyze video quality, detect issues, and provide recommendations.

### 16. üéµ Audio Transcoding

**What**: Convert audio files between different formats and optimize quality.

**Why**: "Perfect audio conversion for podcasts, music, and sound effects. Optimize for quality or file size."

```javascript
// Example API
await transcodeAudio('input.wav', 'output.mp3', {
  bitrate: '320k',
  normalize: true,
  fadeIn: 2,
  fadeOut: 3
});
```

### 17. üñºÔ∏è Image Transcoding

**What**: Convert and optimize images between different formats.

**Why**: "Batch convert your image library. Optimize for web, reduce file sizes, maintain quality."

```javascript
// Example API
await transcodeImage('input.png', 'output.webp', {
  quality: 85,
  resize: { width: 1200, height: 800 },
  optimize: true
});

// Batch processing
const results = await transcodeImageBatch([
  { input: 'image1.png', output: 'image1.webp' },
  { input: 'image2.jpg', output: 'image2.webp' }
], { quality: 85, optimize: true });
```

## Long-Term Vision

### 18. ü§ñ AI-Enhanced Video Processing
