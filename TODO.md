# @profullstack/transcoder - Future Features

This document outlines potential features to enhance the @profullstack/transcoder module, making it more attractive and valuable to users.

## High-Impact, Easy-to-Implement Features

### 5. ✅ Audio Enhancement (Implemented)

**What**: Normalize audio levels, reduce noise, and enhance clarity.

**Why**: "Perfect audio every time. No more straining to hear quiet videos or getting blasted by loud ones."

```javascript
// Example API
await transcode('input.mp4', 'output.mp4', {
  audio: {
    normalize: true,        // Normalize audio levels
    noiseReduction: 0.3,    // Reduce background noise (0.0 to 1.0)
    fadeIn: 1.5,            // Fade in duration in seconds
    fadeOut: 2.0,           // Fade out duration in seconds
    volume: 1.2             // Adjust volume (1.0 = original volume)
  }
});
```

### 7. 📈 Progress Visualization (Not Implemented)

**What**: Web-based UI for monitoring transcoding progress.

**Why**: "See exactly what's happening with your videos in real-time. No more guessing when your videos will be ready."

```javascript
// Example API
const { outputPath, dashboardUrl } = await transcode('input.mp4', 'output.mp4', {
  dashboard: true
});
// Open dashboardUrl in a browser to see progress
```
