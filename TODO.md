});
```

### 2. 📊 Metadata Extraction & Preservation ✅ (IMPLEMENTED)

**What**: Extract and preserve video metadata during transcoding.

**Why**: "Understand your videos better. Preserve what matters."

```javascript
// Example API
const { outputPath, metadata } = await transcode('input.mp4', 'output.mp4');
console.log(metadata.duration, metadata.resolution, metadata.codec);
```

### 3. 🔄 Batch Processing (Not Implemented)

**What**: Process multiple videos with a single command.

**Why**: "Transform your entire video library overnight. Set it and forget it."

```javascript
// Example API
const results = await transcodeBatch([
  { input: 'video1.mov', output: 'video1.mp4' },
  { input: 'video2.avi', output: 'video2.mp4' },
  { input: 'video3.mkv', output: 'video3.mp4' }
]);
```

### 4. 💧 Watermarking ✅ (IMPLEMENTED)

**What**: Add text or image watermarks to videos.

**Why**: "Brand your content effortlessly. Protect your intellectual property."

```javascript
// Example API
await transcode('input.mp4', 'output.mp4', {
  watermark: { image: 'logo.png', position: 'bottomRight', opacity: 0.7 }
});
```

### 5. 🔊 Audio Enhancement (Not Implemented)

**What**: Normalize audio levels, reduce noise, and enhance clarity.

**Why**: "Perfect audio every time. No more straining to hear quiet videos or getting blasted by loud ones."

```javascript
// Example API
await transcode('input.mp4', 'output.mp4', {
  audio: { normalize: true, noiseReduction: 0.3 }
});
```

### 6. 📱 Responsive Video Profiles (Not Implemented)

**What**: Generate multiple versions of a video optimized for different devices and connection speeds.

**Why**: "One video, any device, any connection. Deliver the perfect experience to every viewer."

```javascript
// Example API
await transcode('input.mp4', {
  responsive: true,
  profiles: ['mobile', 'tablet', 'desktop', 'hd']
});
```

### 7. 📈 Progress Visualization (Not Implemented)

**What**: Web-based UI for monitoring transcoding progress.

**Why**: "See exactly what's happening with your videos in real-time. No more guessing when your videos will be ready."

```javascript
// Example API
const { outputPath, dashboardUrl } = await transcode('input.mp4', 'output.mp4', {
  dashboard: true
});
// Open dashboardUrl in a browser to see progress
```

### 8. 🌐 CLI Tool ✅ (IMPLEMENTED)

**What**: Command-line interface for the module.

**Why**: "Powerful video processing right from your terminal. Perfect for scripts and automation."

```bash
# Example CLI usage
transcoder input.mp4 output.mp4 --preset youtube-hd --thumbnails 3
```

```javascript
// Example API
await transcodeAudio('input.wav', 'output.mp3', {
  bitrate: '320k',
  normalize: true,
  fadeIn: 2,
  fadeOut: 3
});
```

### 17. 🖼️ Image Transcoding

**What**: Convert and optimize images between different formats.

**Why**: "Batch convert your image library. Optimize for web, reduce file sizes, maintain quality."

```javascript
// Example API
await transcodeImage('input.png', 'output.webp', {
  quality: 85,
  resize: { width: 1200, height: 800 },
  optimize: true
});

// Batch processing
const results = await transcodeImageBatch([
  { input: 'image1.png', output: 'image1.webp' },
  { input: 'image2.jpg', output: 'image2.webp' }
], { quality: 85, optimize: true });
```
