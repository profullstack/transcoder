Coding Style Guidelines

Indentation:
- Use 2 spaces for indentation, not tabs
- Maintain consistent indentation throughout the codebase

Naming Conventions:
- Use camelCase for variables and functions
- Use PascalCase for classes and components
- Use UPPER_CASE for constants

Formatting:
- Keep line length under 100 characters
- Use semicolons at the end of statements
- Place opening braces on the same line as the statement
- Add spaces around operators

Comments:
- Use JSDoc style comments for functions
- Keep comments up-to-date with code changes
- Comment complex logic, not obvious operations

JavaScript/TypeScript Specific:
- Prefer const over let, avoid var
- Use template literals instead of string concatenation
- Use destructuring where appropriate
- Use async/await instead of raw promises when possible

HTML/CSS Specific:
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Follow BEM naming convention for CSS classes
- Organize CSS properties alphabetically
- Use CSS variables for repeated values
